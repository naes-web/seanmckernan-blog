      <description>Let me start with a disclaimer. I am not a webdev, I know HTML and CSS (kinda), and I have a basic understanding of JavaScript. I was still able to pull this blog off through some trial and error. The process was a learning experience, and I hope to document it with this post, maybe someone will find it useful. I&amp;rsquo;m not the first person to write about this either, a quick google of something like &amp;ldquo;nginx hugo ssl&amp;rdquo; will pull up loads of other guides.</description>
